Playing vs. the IQP: Everything went perfect

In the last example, I've told you White is looking to trade the minor pieces and then blockade the isolated pawn and attack it with his major pieces. Now, a fair question arises: once we did that, then what? Here, we have a very strong idea, please find it.
1.e4!
White wins a pawn, because the d5-pawn is pinned.
1...g6
Instead, if Black just plays some move, we pick up the pawn.
1...dxe4??2.xd7+- And we win a rook and the game.
2.Rxd5 Rxd5 3.Rxd5 Rxd5 4.exd5Â±
With a nearly winning endgame. It might still take work to convert, but we are just a healthy pawn up, which is a pretty great outcome, if you ask me.
4.Qxd5? Would be a mistake, however, because the Black king is too close to the pawn.4...Qxd5 5.exd5 Kf8 6.Kf1 Ke7 7.Ke2 Kd6 8.Kd3 Kxd5= 
...And we wasted all the advantage.
